## Configuration Options
Configuration is managed through environment variables. The options that can be controlled are as follows:

  1. LOOP_WAIT_PERIOD_SECONDS (default: 360) - This is the interval from the end of a countdown until the
       start of the next countdown.
  2. INITIAL_COUNTDOWN_DELAY_SECONDS (default: 5) - Specifies the delay period before the script starts the
       initial countdown. This is to give the person setting up the script enough time to get back in game.
